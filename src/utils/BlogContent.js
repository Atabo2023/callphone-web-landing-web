        title: "",
        content: [
          "In the story of money, things have changed a lot over time. First, people traded goods for other goods, which we call trade by barter. You simply trade what you have to get what you don’t have. It happens to be one of the most innovative ideas of that age, but now it's a thing of history, and it really suits our forefathers.",
          "Then, we started using cowries, coins, and paper money. And the truth is that we didn’t even care how much longer we stayed in the queue to make transactions; as long as the business of the day was done and as long as we could send money to our family and friends, we were perfectly fine with it. If the right word is on my lips, I would say it’s the metro booming and biggest king of the boys of our time. Cash made buying things quicker and more straightforward.",
          "Later on, credit cards came along and made paying for stuff easier. Imagine being in a situation where you are out of cash and you don’t want to go the normal route of having to queue at the bank to get money, or in a situation where you want to comfortably pay for something without having cash. Now imagine you had a card that you could slip through to make payments through a payment gateway. That’s why Callphone product like Airgate comes into play, playing a major part in making things easier for every user.",

          "Like the term “contactless,” it requires no physical contact—just tapping or swapping your card or mobile phone with a card reader, in its simplest terms. ",
          "Contactless payment is a method of transaction where the payment instrument, such as a credit card or smartphone, is simply tapped near a payment terminal to complete a purchase. This process uses Near Field Communication (NFC) or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to securely transmit payment information between the card or device and the terminal without the need for physical contact. Your card or phone in use is like special technology that talks to the payment machine. It's quick and easy.",

          "Now, you might be wondering: Is it safe to use contactless payments? The answer is yes! Contactless payments are just as secure as traditional card transactions, if not more so. That's because contactless payments use advanced encryption and tokenization technology to protect your payment information. Plus, with features like fingerprint authentication and biometric security, you can rest assured that your payments are safe and secure.",

Trend is pretty obvious and is a continuous process walking its way into the horizon.",
